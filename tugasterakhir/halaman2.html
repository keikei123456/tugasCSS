        The word dragon derives from the Greek δράκων (drakōn) and its Latin
        cognate draco. Ancient Greeks applied the term to large, constricting
        snakes. The Greek drakōn was far more associated with poisonous spit or
        breath than the modern Western dragon, though fiery breath is still
        attested in a few myths. There is also the drakaina, the specifically
        female form or "she-dragon." The drakaina is occasionally treated
        differently from the more common masculine or gender-neutral drakōn,
        often surviving by mating with a hero or being the ancestress of an
        important lineage. Daniel Ogden speaks of three ways to explain the
        origins of Greek dragon myths: as vertical evolution from
        (reconstructed) Proto-Indo-European mythology, as horizontal adaptation
        from Ancient Near Eastern mythology, or as sitting within "the cloud of
        international folktale". Regarding theories of horizontal transmission,
        Ogden argues that they carry "an unspoken assumption that prior to such
        a transfer the Greeks' own myth-world was a tabula rasa", which he calls
        absurd; only Typhon's Near Eastern origins are, in his view, plausible.

                  Typhon was the most fearsome monster of Greek mythology.
                  Typhon was the last son of Gaia. He is usually envisioned as
                  humanoid from the waist up, serpentine below, almost the size
                  of a mountain. With his mate Echidna he would father many
                  monsters. Later he would attempt to overthrow Zeus for the
                  title of ruler of the cosmos. Zeus would hurl a enormous rock
                  on him to beat him.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Ladon was the serpent-like drakon (dragon, a word more
                  commonly used) that twined round the tree in the Garden of the
                  Hesperides and guarded the golden apples. Ladon was also said
                  to have as many as one hundred heads. He was overcome and
                  possibly slain by Heracles. After a few years, the Argonauts
                  passed by the same spot, on their chthonic return journey from
                  Colchis at the opposite end of the world, and heard the lament
                  of "shining" Aigle, one of the Hesperides, and viewed the
                  still-twitching Ladon (Argonautica, book iv). The creature is
                  associated with the constellation Draco. Ladon was given
                  several parentages, each of which placed him at an archaic
                  level in Greek myth: the offspring of "Ceto, joined in love
                  with Phorcys" (Hesiod, Theogony 333) or of Typhon, who was
                  himself serpent-like from the waist down, and Echidna
                  (Bibliotheke 2.113; Hyginus, Preface to Fabulae) or of Gaia
                  herself, or in her Olympian manifestation, Hera: "The Dragon
                  which guarded the golden apples was the brother of the Nemean
                  lion" asserted Ptolemy Hephaestion (recorded in his New
                  History V, lost but epitomized in Photius, Myriobiblion 190).

                <p class="card-text">
                  The Lernaean Hydra was a dragon-like water serpent with
                  fatally venomous breath, blood and fangs, a daughter of Typhon
                  and Echidna. The creature was said to have anywhere between
                  five and 100 heads, although most sources put the number
                  somewhere between seven and nine. For each head cut off, one
                  or two more grew back in its place. It had an immortal head
                  which would remain alive after it was cut off. Some accounts
                  claim that the immortal head was made of gold. It lived in a
                  swamp near Lerna and frequently terrorized the townsfolk until
                  it was slain by Heracles, who cut the heads off, with the help
                  of his nephew Iolaus, who then singed the oozing stump with a
                  blazing firebrand to prevent any new heads from growing, as
                  the second of his Twelve Labors. Hera sent a giant crab to
                  distract Heracles, but he simply crushed it under his foot.
                  Hera then placed it in the heavens as the constellation
                  Cancer. After slaying the serpent, Heracles buried the
                  immortal head under a rock and dipped his arrows in the
                  creature's blood to make them fatal to his enemies. In one
                  version, the poisoned arrows would eventually prove to be the
                  undoing of his centaur tutor Chiron, who was placed in the
                  heavens as the constellation Centaurus. In another version, he
                  would never be able to use these arrows because of his fear of
                  the poison spreading through the land and poisoning the water
                  and crops.

                <p class="card-text">
                  In Greek mythology Python was the earth-dragon of Delphi,
                  always represented in the vase-paintings and by sculptors as a
                  serpent. Various myths represented Python as being either male
                  or female (a drakaina). Python was the chthonic enemy of
                  Apollo, who slew it and remade its former home his own oracle,
                  the most famous in Greece. In some myths the dragon was called
                  Delphyne. Delphyne was often pictured as being half girl and
                  half snake. <br />
                  There are various versions of Python's birth and death at the
                  hands of Apollo. In the earliest, the Homeric Hymn to Apollo,
                  little detail is given about Apollo's combat with the serpent
                  or its parentage. The version related by Hyginus holds that
                  when Zeus lay with the goddess Leto, and she was to deliver
                  Artemis and Apollo, Hera sent Python to pursue her throughout
                  the lands, so that she could not be delivered wherever the sun
                  shone. Thus when the infant was grown he pursued the python,
                  making his way straight for Mount Parnassus where the serpent
                  dwelled, and chased it to the oracle of Gaia at Delphi, and
                  dared to penetrate the sacred precinct and kill it with his
                  arrows beside the rock cleft where the priestess sat on her
                  tripod. The priestess of the oracle at Delphi became known as
                  the Pythia, after the place-name Pytho, which was named after
                  the rotting (πύθειν) of the serpent's corpse after it was
                  slain.

                  Colchis) this immense serpent, a child of Typhon and Echidna,
                  guarded the Golden Fleece at Colchis. It was said to never
                  sleep, rest, or lower its vigilance. According to Ovid's
                  Metamorphoses, the monster had a crest and three tongues. When
                  Jason went to retrieve the Fleece, the witch Medea put the
                  dragon to sleep with her magic and drugs, or perhaps Orpheus
                  lulled it to sleep with his lyre. Afterwards, Medea herself
                  had dragons pull her chariot.
